Kotlin is a language created by JetBrains. It runs on top of the JVM (but not only), it is an object oriented language that includes many ideas from functional programming. I wonâ€™t go too much in details about all Kotlin features (PDF, HTML), but I would like to highlight the ones I find the most interesting:

- Kotlin is a statically typed language, but thanks to its clever type inference, it allows you to write code as short and expressive as dynamic language with performances close to pure Java projects
- Properties support
- Relatively lightweight standard library compared to other languages
- Easy to learn: a Java developer can quickly understand most of the language (this quick comparison to Java is worth to read)
- Java interop is a first class concern and great
- Perfect for Android development
- Built-in immutability and null safety support
- Code is easy to read, efficient to write
- Allows to extend existing libraries without having to inherit from the class or use any type of design pattern such as Decorator
- No semicolon required ;-)

Kotlin support in Spring Boot 2.x. This project is an simple example for that, Kotlin could simplify and enhance the  applications by forcing us to write shorter, safer code.## Execution: 

## Execution
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Services
